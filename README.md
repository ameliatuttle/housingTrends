# Overview

For this project I wanted to challenge myself as a software engineer to try a new technology I haven't used before and use a langauge I know in a way I haven't ever used. Instead of focusing on terminal output with python, I used it to make charts that reflected housing trends.

The data set I am analyzing is for houses sold and details about each individual house. The columns in this data set are id, date, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, grade, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated, zipcode, lat, long,s qft_living15, and sqft_lot15. I got this data set from [kaggle.com.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset)

I wrote this program to analyze this data because I was curious about the trends in the housing mrket, and I wanted to learn how to use the pandas library.

# Data Analysis Results

Going into this project my top 3 questions I had about the housing market were How significantly are the prices of homes increasing? How does square footage affect the price? and How does the condition of the house affect its price? To answer the first question, prices are steadily increasing and are currently the most they've ever been. For the second question, square footage increases the price in a pretty steady linear progression. This means square footage and price increase at a similar rate. For the third question, the better condition a house is in the more it sells for, but most houses sell at medium condition rate. 

# Development Environment

For this project the libraries I used were my biggest tools. I used the pandas library, matplotlib library, and the seaborn library. The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. In this program I used it in data manipulation to clean the data set and to aggregate/group by certian columns. The matplotlib and seaborn library create the actaul chart. matplot creates the charts and seaborn is used to simplify the syntax for matplotlib.
